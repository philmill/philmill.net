# What is Art?

Is art an evolutionary trait developed post communication as the *self* progressed?

If I break a glass cup out of frustration is it "art" if no one sees it break, if there's no witness to it's change in
state? Does this act become "art" because someone observes me in a state of frustration? What if I film it or take a
photo of it's remains as a representation of my original frustration? Would I have to write a note about it? As our
ancestral experience included communication, did the act of expression become an abstraction?

To Shadow (a dog) she is dog, but to me she is a beautiful expression of genes which could be interpreted as an
expression of a god or natural selection (a work of art). The 'purity' of this dog's existance can only be experienced
by high level conscience beings who can extract references in relation to past experiences.

This is an example of a blog post.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and
got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned
on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath,
that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but
it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in
American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular
gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.
You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
