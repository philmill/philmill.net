# What is Art?

Is art an evolutionary trait developed post communication as the *self* progressed?

If I break a glass cup out of frustration is it "art" if no one sees it break, if there's no witness to it's change in
state? Does this act become "art" because someone observes me in a state of frustration? What if I film it or take a
photo of it's remains as a representation of my original frustration? Would I have to write a note about it? As our
ancestral experience included communication, did the act of expression become an abstraction?

To Shadow (a dog) she is dog, but to me she is a beautiful expression of genes which could be interpreted as an
expression of a god or natural selection (a work of art). The 'purity' of this dog's existance can only be experienced
by high level conscience beings who can extract references in relation to past experiences.

This is an example of a blog post.
