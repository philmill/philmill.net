## My personal site using [Nesta CMS](https://github.com/gma/nesta) with added Amazon S3 buckets and Compass support using Redcarpet as the Markdown parser. 
Thanks to Brian Gonzalez for setting up a [Nesta Boilerplate](https://github.com/briangonzalez/nesta-boilerplate) which my Compass support is based on.
